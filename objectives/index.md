## Learning objectives

Students should be able to do each of the following by the end of this course:


### What is statistics? overview of the course
* Describe the central goals and fundamental concepts of statistics.
* Describe the difference between experimental and observational research with regard to what can be inferred about causality
* Explain how randomization provides the ability to make inferences about causation.

### Working with data 
* Distinguish between different types of variables (quantitative/qualitative, discrete/continuous, scales of measurement)
* Describe the concept of measurement error
* Distinguish between the concepts of reliability and validity and apply each concept to a particular dataset

### R Lab: Basics
* Interact with an RMarkdown notebook in RStudio
* Describe the difference between a variable and a function
* Create a vector, matrix, or data frame and access its elements
* Load a data file into a data frame and plots its contents

### Summarizing data
* Compute absolute, relative, and cumulative frequency distributions for a given dataset
* Generate a graphical representation of frequency distributions
* Describe the difference between a normal and a long-tailed distribution, and describe the situations that give rise to each

### Fitting models (central tendency)
* Describe the basic equation for statistical models (outcome=model + error)
* Describe different measures of central tendency and dispersion, how they are computed, and how to determine which is most appropriate in any given circumstance.

### Visualizing data
* Describe the principles that distinguish between good and bad graphs, and use them to identify good versus bad graphs.

### Z-scores
* Describe the concept of a Z-score and compute them from a dataset

### R lab: Data wrangling and visualization
* Describe the concept of tidy data
* Load a data file and prepare it for analysis
* Plot summary graphs using ggplot

### Probability
* Describe the difference between a probability and a conditional probability
* Describe the concept of statistical independence
* Use Bayesâ€™ theorem to compute the inverse conditional probability.

### R lab: probability
* Compute probabilities of combinations of events
* Compute an empirical probability distribution
* Describe the different functions available for the normal distribution, and their usage

### Sampling
* Distinguish between a population and a sample, and between population parameters and statistics
* Describe the concepts of sampling error and sampling distribution
* Describe how the Central Limit Theorem determines the nature of the sampling distribution of the mean

### Resampling
* Describe the statistical concept of a random number
* Describe the concept of Monte Carlo simulation
* Describe the concept of the bootstrap and use it to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic

### R Lab: Simulation and resampling
* Demostrate the ability to implement a Monte Carlo simulation in R

### Robust estimation
* Describe the concept of an outlier and the mechanisms that can cause them
* Describe the effects of outiers on the mean and the potential ways to prevent them
* Describe how transformations of the data can reduce the impact of outliers and the contexts in which such transformations are appropriate

### Hypothesis testing
* Describe how resampling can be used to compute a p-value.
* Define the concept of statistical power, and compute statistical power for a given statistical test.
* Describe the main criticisms of null hypothesis statistical testing

### Confidence intervals and effect sizes
* Describe the proper interpretation of a confidence interval, and compute a confidence interval for the mean of a given dataset.
* Define the concept of effect size, and compute the effect size for a given test.

### Assumptions of modeling and model selection
* Describe the relation between model complexity and generalization
* Describe the concept of crossvalidation and how it can be used to determine model complexity
* Describe the IID assumption and the possible consequences of violating it

### Modeling categorical relationships
* Describe the concept of a contingency table for categorical data.
* Describe the concept of the chi-squared test for association and compute it for a given contingency table.

### Modeling continuous relationships
* Describe the concept of the correlation coefficient and its interpretation and compute it for a bivariate dataset
* Describe the potential causal influences that can give rise to a correlation.

### The general linear model
* Describe the concept of linear regression and apply it to a bivariate dataset
* Describe the concept of the general linear model and provide examples of its application

### Comparing means
* Determine whether a one-sample t-test or two-sample t-test is appropriate for a given hypothesis.
* Compute a one-sample and two-sample t-test on relevant datasets, and compute the effect size and confidence intervals associated with each of these tests.

### Statistical Inference R lab
* Demonstrate the ability to apply statistical models to real data in R
